**TL;DR**: I am actively seeking employment for entry level and junior software developer roles whether full stack, backend or SRE focused. I am available to start work in March 2025 and I am open to remote / hybrid / onsite roles, although I would require a visa sponsorship for onsite roles. Check out my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lXWrnwShfF6sOL6Plf79WRoTpDW0kNLS/view) and [Portfolio](https://esthertimothy.netlify.app/) and you can contact me through my [email.](mailto:morayotimothy@gmail.com)

### My Experience

Hi, my nameâ€™s Esther and I am a Software Developer Intern working on [Wiki Education](https://wikiedu.org/)â€™s project "[Improve observability of Wiki Education Dashboard](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Emptycodes#Outreachy_Project%3A_Improve_observability_of_Wiki_Education_Dashboard)" as an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) participant.  
Including my current Internship, I have 9 months formal working experience (6 months hybrid and 3 months fully remote). I also have around 5 and counting months experience in the open source space.  
  
My work in the [Wiki Education Dashboard](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/) falls under Site Reliability Engineering and Full Stack Development and my day to day involves a copious amount of debugging, documentation and research. See the [technical guide](https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/blob/master/docs/admin_guide.md) I wrote for the Dashboard and my WikiEduDashboard [commit history](https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/commits?author=empty-codes) for a clearer picture. My work on the Dashboard has been a very rewarding and eye-opening experience so far.

### My Career Goals

I am currently a full stack engineer - backend focused and I intend to continue exploring a mix of backend engineering, DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering. I have dabbled in C#, Python, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML and CSS and I am currently working with Ruby on Rails and React at my internship. I am also an AI enthusiast and I have some experience building machine learning models for prediction and analysis with Python.  
  
I like to think of myself as a generalist and as such I intend on exploring various fields within the technological space especially since I am just starting out in my career. I would like to work in an organization that makes an impact, someway, somehow or somewhere because by extension I would be making meaningful impact too.

### Why You Should Hire Me

\- I have experience understanding and debugging large codebases from my previous internships  
\- I have experience collaborating with remote teams and in varied time zones  
\- It sounds clichÃ© but I am a fast learner and painstakingly detail oriented, so for example, the chances of me breaking production are very low ( but never zeroðŸ™ƒ).  
\- I work well with deadlines and I take responsibility for tasks that I am assigned  
\- Most importantly, I have unlimited potential. My goal is to be a 2x dev, 4x, 6x, 8x and even 10x dev in the long run  
\- I graduated with a first class Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science in mid 2024  
\- I am fluent in English and I am also open to learning other languages â€” I did French IGCSEs and I understand Korean at a beginner level  
\- I read a lot so my mind is quite imaginative

A fun fact about me to part with; one of my life goals is to rear a cow and make my own milk, ergo my own cheese and butter - Mozzarella cheese prices are crazy!
