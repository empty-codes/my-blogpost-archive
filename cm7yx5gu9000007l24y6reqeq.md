My Outreachy Internship with the Wikimedia Foundation is officially coming to an end and I am already going through withdrawal.

### A Project Report of Sorts

My project titled ‘[**Improve observability of Wiki Education Dashboard**](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T378119)’ focused on improving the observability of the Dashboard and making it easier for system administrators — and possibly end-users as well — to detect and understand problems with the system. My deliverables were set as the following and I am proud to say I successfully completed them:

* Reduce noise in Sentry: [Merged commits](https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/commits?author=empty-codes) ✔
    
* A user-friendly system status and performance information UI: [https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/status](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/status) and [https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/status](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/status)✔
    
* Documentation for Dashboard Deployment in CloudVPS and Toolforge in form of an ‘[Admin Guide](https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard/blob/master/docs/admin_guide.md)’✔
    

Do read [my previous blog posts](https://emptycodesalsowrites.hashnode.dev/series/wikimedia) for a detailed breakdown of my project.  
  
My experience taught me:

* the importance of tests and how they can be used to both debug an error and also ensure the system works fine
    
* the importance of reusable and maintainable code as some parts of the codebase hasn't been touched in 5+ years
    
* the approach to understand a new and big codebase so now I feel less intimidated about diving into big codebases
    
* the importance of asking the right questions and documenting debugging efforts
    
* and finally, the importance of communication and community within the open source space; A lot of software developers are introverts but such projects and internships encourage community, building relationships and networking.
    

All in all, I daresay this was the best 3 months of my life. I am very proud of the work I have done with the Dashboard, my co-intern [Formasit Chijoh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/formasit-chijoh-0a9a5b202/) and my esteemed mentor, [Sage Ross](https://wikiedu.org/blog/team-details/sage-ross/)💖. The me 3 months before, cannot hold a candle to the me now so I’m looking forward to see how much much and farther I can go in the next 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.  
  
I plan to continue contributing to the `WikiEduDashboard` and helping Sage maintain the project.
